			li(class='terms-and-conditions-commissions__list-item') Master Affiliates will distribute affiliate revenue on a weekly basis every Monday. Positive affiliate commissions are eligible for cash-out once a week during the first days of the week. Any negative balances will be carried over to the next period until the commissions become positive and cover the negative carryover. 
			li(class='terms-and-conditions-commissions__list-item') The general payment rules and norms for customers will apply to affiliate payments. 
			li(class='terms-and-conditions-commissions__list-item') Master Affiliates will pay you the agreed commission based on the net losses of referred players. Affiliate net losses are calculated by subtracting bonuses, fees, cashbacks, rebates, chargebacks, and any incentives or adjustments from the gross revenue, divided by the agreed or system-granted revenue share percentage. 
			li(class='terms-and-conditions-commissions__list-item') We reserve the right to offer different revenue share percentages to different affiliates based on their performance. 
			li(class='terms-and-conditions-commissions__list-item') Affiliates will earn commissions for the lifetime of referred customers as long as they remain active members promoting the Master Affiliates partners in good standing.
